      para2 : 'Zirconia products are characterised by good mechanical properties and stability at high temperatures, strong thermal and corrosion resistance, chemical inertness and consistent quality. This makes them ideal for use in a wide range of refractory products, ceramic colours and pigments and electronic applications.',
      para3 : 'Other applications include friction materials, welding rods and zirconium metal and alloys. Advanced zirconia ceramics have excellent biocompatibility ensuring zirconia has replaced alumina as the material of choice for prosthesis devices such as hip joints or femoral ball heads. It has superior strength and hardness, wear resistance, stability, resistance to scratching and biocompatibility with the human body. One of zirconia’s other most common uses is within dental implants.',

      para1 : 'Silicon carbide (SiC), also known as carborundum, is a hard chemical compound containing silicon and carbon. A semiconductor, it occurs in nature as the extremely rare mineral moissanite, but has been mass-produced as a powder and crystal.',
      para2 : 'Grains of silicon carbide can be bonded together by sintering to form very hard ceramics that are widely used in applications requiring high endurance, such as car brakes, car clutches and ceramic plates in bulletproof vests. Large single crystals of silicon carbide can be grown by the Lely method and they can be cut into gems known as synthetic moissanite.',
      para3 : 'Silicon carbide is used as an abrasive, as well as a semiconductor and diamond simulant of gem quality. The simplest process to manufacture silicon carbide is to combine silica sand and carbon in an Acheson graphite electric resistance furnace at a high temperature, between 1,600 °C (2,910 °F) and 2,500 °C (4,530 °F).',

      para1 : 'A Hot Air Oven is a laboratory appliance that is used to dry, sterilize, or heat materials. It works by circulating hot air inside the oven chamber to evenly distribute heat to the materials being processed. Hot air ovens are often used in a variety of settings, including research laboratories, industrial settings, and educational institutions.',
      para2 : 'Hot air ovens typically have a temperature range of ambient temperature to 250°C or higher and are equipped with a thermostat to maintain a consistent temperature. Some hot air ovens also have a fan to circulate the hot air inside the oven chamber, which can help to ensure that the materials being processed are heated or dried evenly. Hot air ovens are commonly used to sterilize equipment and materials, as the high temperatures can kill microorganisms. They are also used to dry materials, such as chemicals, biological specimens, and glassware. In addition, hot air ovens can be used to heat materials for a variety of purposes, such as activating chemicals or heating materials to a specific temperature for testing.',
